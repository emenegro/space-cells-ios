# Space Cells

![Icon](etc/icon.png)

Exercising collection view **loading**, **configuration** and **interaction** on iOS VIPER architecture.

The motivation is to explore the implementation of a mechanism tho allow the interaction with components inside cells without involving the view.

## Example app
This app is composed of three views:

- The main view showing a list of space posters.
- An information view shown when tapping information button.
- A detail view that shows the whole poster when tapping the cell.

## //TODO:
- **Allow loading of multiple cell types.**
- UI testing.
- Pull requests and comments are welcomed!
